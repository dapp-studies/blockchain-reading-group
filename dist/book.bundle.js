Once on path,\nAS-level adversaries can then partition the Bitcoin network or delay block\npropagation significantly. The key factors that enable these attacks are the\nextreme centralization of Bitcoin, both from a routing and a mining\nperspective, along with the fact that Bitcoin messages are sent unencrypted,\nwithout integrity guarantees.\n  We demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale attacks in practice against the\ndeployed Bitcoin software and quantify their disruptive network-wide impact.\nThe potential damage to Bitcoin is severe. By isolating a part of the network\nor delaying the propagation of blocks, network-level attackers can cause a\nsignificant amount of mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and\nenabling a wide range of attacks such as double spending.

Bitcoin nodes continuously generate and propagate\nblocks---collections of newly approved transactions that are added to Bitcoin's\nledger. Block creation requires nodes to invest computational resources, but\nalso carries a reward in the form of bitcoins that are paid to the creator.\nWhile the protocol requires nodes to quickly distribute newly created blocks,\nstrong nodes can in fact gain higher payoffs by withholding blocks they create\nand selectively postponing their publication. The existence of such selfish\nmining attacks was first reported by Eyal and Sirer, who have demonstrated a\nspecific deviation from the standard protocol (a strategy that we name SM1).\n  In this paper we extend the underlying model for selfish mining attacks, and\nprovide an algorithm to find $\\epsilon$-optimal policies for attackers within\nthe model, as well as tight upper bounds on the revenue of optimal policies. As\na consequence, we are able to provide lower bounds on the computational power\nan attacker needs in order to benefit from selfish mining. We find that the\nprofit threshold -- the minimal fraction of resources required for a profitable\nattack -- is strictly lower than the one induced by the SM1 scheme. Indeed, the\npolicies given by our algorithm dominate SM1, by better regulating\nattack-withdrawals.\n  Using our algorithm, we show that Eyal and Sirer's suggested countermeasure\nto selfish mining is slightly less effective than previously conjectured. Next,\nwe gain insight into selfish mining in the presence of communication delays,\nand show that, under a model that accounts for delays, the profit threshold\nvanishes, and even small attackers have incentive to occasionally deviate from\nthe protocol.

We illustrate our approach through the analysis of Bitcoin, a\ncryptocurrency known for its large price fluctuations. In our analysis, we\ninclude economic signals of volume and price of exchange for USD, adoption of\nthe Bitcoin technology, and transaction volume of Bitcoin. We add social\nsignals related to information search, word of mouth volume, emotional valence,\nand opinion polarization as expressed in tweets related to Bitcoin for more\nthan 3 years. Our analysis reveals that increases in opinion polarization and\nexchange volume precede rising Bitcoin prices, and that emotional valence\nprecedes opinion polarization and rising exchange volumes. We apply these\ninsights to design algorithmic trading strategies for Bitcoin, reaching very\nhigh profits in less than a year. We verify this high profitability with robust\nstatistical methods that take into account risk and trading costs, confirming\nthe long-standing hypothesis that trading based social media sentiment has the\npotential to yield positive returns on investment.","author":"Frank Schweitzer","journal_ref":"Royal Society Open Science, 2:150288, 2015","arxiv_id":"1506.01513v2","pdf_link":"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01513v2","all_categories":["cs.SI","q-fin.TR"],"published":"2015-06-04T09:01:55Z","primary_category":"Social and Information Networks"},{"abs_page_link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01001v1","title":"Linear Types Can Change the Blockchain","abstract":"We give an interpretation of full classical linear logic, and linear proofs\nin terms of operations on the blockchain.","author":"Lucius Gregory Meredith","arxiv_id":"1506.01001v1","pdf_link":"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01001v1","all_categories":["cs.LO"],"published":"2015-06-02T19:35:08Z","primary_category":"Logic in Computer Science"},{"abs_page_link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06895v2","comment":"15 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables in Proceedings of NDSS 2016","title":"Centrally Banked Cryptocurrencies","abstract":"Current cryptocurrencies, starting with Bitcoin, build a decentralized\nblockchain-based transaction ledger, maintained through proofs-of-work that\nalso generate a monetary supply.

Since its\nintroduction in 2008, Bitcoin has gained noticeable popularity, mostly due to\nits following properties: (1) the transaction fees are very low, and (2) it is\nnot controlled by any central authority, which in particular means that nobody\ncan \"print\" the money to generate inflation. Moreover, the transaction syntax\nallows to create the so-called contracts, where a number of\nmutually-distrusting parties engage in a protocol to jointly perform some\nfinancial task, and the fairness of this process is guaranteed by the\nproperties of Bitcoin. Although the Bitcoin contracts have several potential\napplications in the digital economy, so far they have not been widely used in\nreal life. This is partly due to the fact that they are cumbersome to create\nand analyze, and hence risky to use.\n  In this paper we propose to remedy this problem by using the methods\noriginally developed for the computer-aided analysis for hardware and software\nsystems, in particular those based on the timed automata. More concretely, we\npropose a framework for modeling the Bitcoin contracts using the timed automata\nin the UPPAAL model checker. Our method is general and can be used to model\nseveral contracts.

We claim that these built-in properties are not as brilliant as\nthey are sometimes claimed. A closer examination reveals that they are closer\nto being... engineering mistakes which other crypto currencies have copied\nrather blindly. More precisely we show that the capacity of current crypto\ncurrencies to resist double spending attacks is poor and most current crypto\ncurrencies are highly vulnerable. Satoshi did not implement a timestamp for\nbitcoin transactions and the bitcoin software does not attempt to monitor\ndouble spending events. As a result major attacks involving hundreds of\nmillions of dollars can occur and would not even be recorded. Hundreds of\nmillions have been invested to pay for ASIC hashing infrastructure yet\ninsufficient attention was paid to network neutrality and to insure that the\nprotection layer it promises is effective and cannot be abused.

These affect their hash rate and therefore their protection\nagainst double spending attacks which we do not limit the to the notion of 51%\nattacks which is highly misleading. In addition we show that smaller bitcoin\ncompetitors are substantially more vulnerable.

A paper at Financial\nCryptography 2012 conference explains that it is a system which \"uses no fancy\ncryptography\", and is \"by no means perfect\". It depends on a well-known\ncryptographic standard SHA-256. In this paper we revisit the cryptographic\nprocess which allows one to make money by producing bitcoins. We reformulate\nthis problem as a Constrained Input Small Output (CISO) hashing problem and\nreduce the problem to a pure block cipher problem. We estimate the speed of\nthis process and we show that the cost of this process is less than it seems\nand it depends on a certain cryptographic constant which we estimated to be at\nmost 1.86. These optimizations enable bitcoin miners to save tens of millions\nof dollars per year in electricity bills. Miners who set up mining operations\nface many economic incertitudes such as high volatility. In this paper we point\nout that there are fundamental incertitudes which depend very strongly on the\nbitcoin specification. The energy efficiency of bitcoin miners have already\nbeen improved by a factor of about 10,000, and we claim that further\nimprovements are inevitable. Better technology is bound to be invented, would\nit be quantum miners. More importantly, the specification is likely to change.\nA major change have been proposed in May 2013 at Bitcoin conference in San\nDiego by Dan Kaminsky. However, any sort of change could be flatly rejected by\nthe community which have heavily invested in mining with the current\ntechnology. Another question is the reward halving scheme in bitcoin. The\ncurrent bitcoin specification mandates a strong 4-year cyclic property.
